# Heroku Migration Accelerator

Many of these files are automatically generated when you create a CDK app. The relevant files for my project are both in the hello_cdk folder; discover_heroku.py is the discovery script and hello_cdk_stack.py is the CloudFormation generation script.

Run the tool by running discover_heroku.py. More details are in my instructional blog post.

REQUIREMENT TO RUN THE SCRIPTS 
1. HEROKU CREDENTIALS
2. NAME OF THE APP YOU WANTT TO MIGRATE 
3. CREATE AN IAM USER FOR THE APPLICATION ON YOUR AWS ACOUNT THE SAVE YOUR AWS ACCESS KEY ID & AWS SECRET ACCESSS KEY
